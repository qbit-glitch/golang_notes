## Why `WHERE 1=1` in the SQL query

`WHERE 1=1` is always true and acts as a placeholder to simplify appending additional conditions dynamically. It allows us to add conditions without worrying about whether it's the first conditions or not, avoiding the need to check if you should start with WHERE or add an AND. 

`WHERE 1=1` also simplify the code for adding filters. Without  `WHERE 1=1`, you would need to check if the WHERE clause already exists before adding `AND` for each filter which adds extra complexity. And using this `WHERE 1=1`, we can actually handle multiple filters.

In conclusion, using `WHERE 1=1` is a common practice for making dynamic query buliding more straightformward. It avoids the need for complex conditional logic when appending multiple filter conditions, making your code cleaner and easier to maintain.
