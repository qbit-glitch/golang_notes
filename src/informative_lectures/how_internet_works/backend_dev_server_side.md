# Backend / Server Side


The backend also known as server side, refers to the part od a web application that runs on the server and is responsible for processing requests, managing data and performing application logic. So the complete application logic resides in the server on your server-side application. The backend handles the server side operations that support the functionality of a web application. It processes requests from the frontend, interacts with databases, performs computations and sends responses back to the client.
